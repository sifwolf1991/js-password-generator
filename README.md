5. Usage
This application can be used as a password generator, which will generate a random password between 8-128 characters long, with a user selection of character types. The Javascript file provides comments to identify different parts of code and its function.

The Javascript file contains variables for input types, including alpha-numerical, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters. It uses conditional statements to:

• Remind the user the allowable password length

• Check the correct characters are entered into the text boxes

• Generate prompts to provide user choice of character types

This app uses a for loop to randomize the password, and uses event listeners to provide interactivity.
